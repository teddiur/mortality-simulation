a simulation similar to the Washington Post one but with mortality

##TO DO LIST
-create a death method to Particle class (does it turns into some color or desappear?)

-implement mortality rate (how?)

-plot #healthy, #sick, #recovered, #dead vs time
-add it into the same window of the simulation

-recalculate "mortality mean rate" with data of countries that handled badly and well crisis

-rerun the simulation with different % of social isolation people (speed == 0)
