# mortality-simulation
a simulation similar to the Washington Post one but with mortability

TO DO LIST
1)
-create a death method to Particle class (does it turns into some color or desappear?)

2)
-calculate a local "mortality mean rate" taking into consideration the demographic info of SÃ£o Paulo
-implement mortality rate (how?)

3)
-plot #healthy, #sick, #recovered, #dead vs time
-add it into the same window of the simulation

4)
-recalculate "mortality mean rate" with data of countries that handled badly and well crisis

5)
-rerun the simulation with different % of social isolation people (speed == 0)

6)
-rerun the simulation without graphic display to average results
